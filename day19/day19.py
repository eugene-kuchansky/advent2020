    # but we won't do it actually.
    # new rules contains links to themselves and thus infinite loops would not allow to calc all possible patterns
    #
    # the only higher level rule which depends on rules 8 and 11 is the root rule "0: 8 11"
    # let's try to analyze what the loop "8: 42 | 42 8" actually means
    # for example rule 42 contains of ['a', 'b'] patterns
    # in first loop iteration we should add patterns which are product of initial patterns - ['aa', 'ab', 'ba', 'bb']
    # so the result is ['a', 'b', 'aa', 'ab', 'ba', 'bb']
    # in the second loop will add all permutation of 3 elements from 'aaa' to 'bbb' and 4 elements 'aaaa' - 'bbbb'
    # instead of endless generation we'll derive a rule:
    # rule 8 patterns consist of all possible combinations of rule 42 patterns and nothing more
    #
    # second replacement is a bit trickier - "11: 42 31 | 42 11 31"
    # again, for example rule 42 contains of ['a', 'b'] patterns. rule 31 - of ['x', 'y']
    # on first iteration rule 11 consists of product of 2 rules - ['aX', 'aY', 'bX', 'bY']
    # on the second iteration we'll add product of 3 rules - 42 11 31:
    # ['aaXX', 'aaXY', 'aaYX', 'aaYY', 'abXX', 'abXY', 'abYX', 'abYY', 'baXX', 'baXY', 'baYX', 'baYY', 'bbXX', 'bbXY', 'bbYX', 'bbYY']
    # and here goes general rule for 11:
    # rule 11 patterns consist of any combinations of rule 42 patterns plus the same number of combinations of rule 31 patterns
    # so any zero rule pattern can be defined as junction of:
    # - n patterns of 42 rule plus
    # - m patterns of 42 rule plus
    # - m patterns of 31 rule plus
    # where n and m any positive numbers
    # this works only if all patterns are unique
